It was created to replace `http_parser.c` since calling C++ function from JS is really slow in V8.\n\nThis was further modified by Jimbly to be useable in parsing responses, specifically tested with the \"request\" module, and addresses issues such as corrupt HTTP headers, which would otherwise cause Node's parser to throw a fatal error (HPE_INVALID_HEADER_TOKEN).\n\nJan Schär (jscissr) made some bigger changes and added tests. This fixed some bugs and added many missing features.\n\nThis is packaged as a standalone npm module.  To use in node, monkeypatch HTTPParser.\n\n```js\n// Monkey patch before you require http for the first time.\nprocess.binding('http_parser').HTTPParser = require('http-parser-js').HTTPParser;\n\nvar http = require('http');\n// ...\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nSimply do `npm test`. The tests are copied from node and mscedex/io.js, with some modifcations.\n\n## Status\n\nThis should now be usable in any node application, it now supports (nearly) everything `http_parser.c` does while still being tolerant with corrupted headers.\n\n## License\n\nMIT.
